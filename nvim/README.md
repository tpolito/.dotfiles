# Neovim config

## Todos, painpoints, & bugs
- [x] Configure `tsserver` to work along side `denols`
- [] Configure godot (gdscript server + port, etc)
- [x] There is a lot of flashing where (I think) some sort of highlighting (either treesitter or the lsp?) is making all the text flashing
    - I _think_ this only happens when I'm inside my `.config` file so I'll check it off for now.
## Notes
- Svelte requires some combonation of html, css, javascript, typescript and svelte to function. Both on the treesitter level and lsp
- [Docs for setting up `denols` along side tsserver `tsserver`](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/setup_your_environment#neovim-06-using-the-built-in-language-server)
